My name is Joshua Grey.  My main strength is programming, and I am committed to having strong time management and strong verbal and written communication skills.  I value protecting people and adhering to laws.  What makes me interested in cybersecurity is that in today's world, everything is going digital, which leads to a greater risk of your personal information getting leaked.  My strengths, values, and interest in cybersecurity allow for a company to adhere to its security goals by allowing me to communicate to other members of the company that, in today's world, a person's data can get leaked and that we need to make our security a lot tighter, especially in today's world of almost everything being digital.
